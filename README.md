# DungeonMasterTools
A collection of Python scripts to remove tedium from being a dungeon master. This tool is useful for Pathfinder as of now, but I plan on making it just as useful for D&amp;D

As of now it only creates an HTML file through Python. Am considering making a front facing website using Django, but TBD.
