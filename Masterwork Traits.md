# Masterwork Traits

Here is a comprehensive list of all Masterwork Traits available from this Generator. When picking Masterwork Traits, there are a few rules to consider;

1. Mundane weapons and armor cannot have masterwork traits attached to them. You must make the weapon/armor masterwork first.
2. When adding a trait to a weapon or armor, the item must meet the prerequisite.
3. The total number of masterwork traits added up cannot exceed the total Masterwork Quality. i.e. If your item is a +2 item, you may have two +1 traits or one +2 trait.
4. A weapon cannot exceed a +10 in Masterwork Quality.

Here are the costs of Upgrading a Weapon to Masterwork or adding a Masterwork Trait.

| Upgrade |  Cost  | Upgrade |  Cost  |
|:-------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|
| +1      | 2000   | +2      | 8000   |
| +3      | 18000  | +4      | 32000  |
| +5      | 50000  | +6      | 72000  |
| +7      | 98000  | +8      | 128000 |
| +9      | 162000 | +10     | 200000 |

For example, adding Adaptive to a bow will cost a total of 4,000 GP. +1 costs 2,000 GP, and Adaptive costs 2,000 GP. When upgrading an item which is already Masterwork, it costs the amount listed, minus the current masterwork cost. For example, upgrading our Adaptive Bow to +5 would cost 48,000. +5 costs 50,000 GP minus +2 which costs 2,000 GP.
